## [Session](https://getsession.org/) is often touted as a private & secure messaging app. Here are some things you may want to consider before using it.

In December 2020, Session transitioned from the [Signal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol) to what they are calling the [Session Protocol](https://www.getsession.org/blog/session-protocol-technical-information), which loses many importantant security properties of the Signal protocol, such as [forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy), which is considered an important property by [security experts](https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1462205937771589638).

[Lokinet](https://lokinet.org/), the "anonymous, decentralized and IP based overlay network for the internet." requires 15,000 OXEN tokens (around $1,100 in today's money) to meet the staking requirement to register your Service Node). Do you think normal people are going to invest in a token that is [losing value](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oxen/usd) for no benefit other than getting more tokens? This is the opposite of anonymous & decentralized. [SimpleX Chat](https://simplex.chat/) [has commented on this](https://x.com/SimpleXChat/status/1802442092125552922).
