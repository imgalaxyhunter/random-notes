## [Session](https://getsession.org/) is often touted as a secure messaging app. Here are some things you may want to consider before using it.

In December 2020, Session transitioned from the [Signal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol) to what they are calling the [Session Protocol](https://www.getsession.org/blog/session-protocol-technical-information), which loses many importantant security properties of the Signal protocol, such as [forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy), [repudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation) (deniability) which are considered important properties by [security experts](x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1462205937771589638).

Along with that, they fail to protect the [recovery phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_wallet#Seed_phrases), which is accessible two taps away in the app and not protected with a PIN or biometrics. This allows an attacker to permanently take over a Session account, giving them access to recent and all future messages, without the victim being notified.
